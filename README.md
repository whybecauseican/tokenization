# NewToken Smart Contract

This project is a straightforward **NewToken** smart contract developed in Solidity. It enables users to mint and burn tokens, offering a foundational framework for token management on the Ethereum blockchain. The token includes attributes like name, symbol, and total supply, along with features to manage user balances.

## Features
- Mint new tokens to a specified address.
- Burn tokens from a specified address.
- Track total supply and user balances.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/newtoken.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd newtoken
    ```

3. Open the project files in your preferred text editor or IDE.

## Usage

1. To use the contract, open the Solidity file (`NewToken.sol`) in any environment that can compile Solidity (e.g., Remix).

2. Test the functions by running the following code snippets after deploying the contract:

    ```solidity
    // Minting tokens
    createTokens(address(0xRecipientAddress), 100);

    // Burning tokens
    removeTokens(address(0xHolderAddress), 50);
    ```

3. After running, you can check the balance and total supply to confirm the transactions.

## Functions

### `createTokens(address _recipient, uint256 _value)`
- Mints new tokens to the specified recipient address.

### `removeTokens(address _holder, uint256 _value)`
- Burns tokens from the specified holder's balance, ensuring the balance is sufficient.
